<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This is an undergrad/graduate level course in computer networking. The 
emphasis will be on the basic performance and engineering 
tradeoffs in the design and implementation of computer networks, with a focus on the
Internet. The second half of the course includes several classic and recent research papers, which cover 
some important problems in networking. 
The goal is for students to learn not only how the Internet works  today, but also the rationale behind its 
design and how it is likely to evolve in the future. The class includes multiple hands-on 
programming assignments and an open ended project.  


Topics to be covered include: networked applications (e.g., web, p2p), reliability, congestion and flow control, 
routing, addressing, naming, wireless, and new Internet architectures.

<p>
We will use Piazza for discussions and announcements.

<!--
15-744 is a graduate course in computer networks.  The goals are:
<ul>
 <li>To understand the state of the art in network protocols, network architecture, and networked systems.</li>
 <li>To understand how to engage in networking research.</li>
 <li>To investigate novel ideas in networking through a semester-long research project.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The past few years have seen a remarkable growth in the global
network infrastructure. The Internet has grown from a research
curiosity to something we all take for granted.
</p>
<p>
How does this network infrastructure work?  What are the design principles
upon which it is based, and how are those principles applied in practice?
How can we make the Internet work better today?  We will examine these
issues and more during the course.
</p>

<p>
This course assumes a basic familiarity with networking concepts.
The course will consist of a reading/lecture/discussion component
and a project component. The class will cover approximately 50
research papers on various aspects of computer networking. These
papers will introduce students to the basic design principles on
which today's networks are based. In addition, these papers will
cover recent proposals to improve network performance, functionality
and scalability. Specific topics that will be covered include:
LAN/WAN technologies, congestion/flow control, traffic analysis,
routing, internetworking, multicast, security, and quality of
service. Students are expected to read papers before the class and
participate in the discussion during the class.
