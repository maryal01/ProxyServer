==16412== 
==16412==     Valgrind's memory management: out of memory:
==16412==        memcheck:allocate new SecMap's request for 16384 bytes failed.
==16412==        1,004,584,960 bytes have already been mmap-ed ANONYMOUS.
==16412==     Valgrind cannot continue.  Sorry.
==16412== 
==16412==     There are several possible reasons for this.
==16412==     - You have some kind of memory limit in place.  Look at the
==16412==       output of 'ulimit -a'.  Is there a limit on the size of
==16412==       virtual memory or address space?
==16412==     - You have run out of swap space.
==16412==     - Valgrind has a bug.  If you think this is the case or you are
==16412==     not sure, please let us know and we'll try to fix it.
==16412==     Please note that programs can take substantially more memory than
==16412==     normal when running under Valgrind tools, eg. up to twice or
==16412==     more, depending on the tool.  On a 64-bit machine, Valgrind
==16412==     should be able to make use of up 32GB memory.  On a 32-bit
==16412==     machine, Valgrind should be able to use all the memory available
==16412==     to a single process, up to 4GB if that's how you have your
==16412==     kernel configured.  Most 32-bit Linux setups allow a maximum of
==16412==     3GB per process.
==16412== 
==16412==     Whatever the reason, Valgrind cannot continue.  Sorry.
